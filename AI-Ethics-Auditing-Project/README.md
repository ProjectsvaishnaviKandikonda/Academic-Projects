**AI Ethics Auditing Project: Enterprise Workforce Optimization Systems**

- This project conducted a comprehensive ethical audit of an AI-driven platform used to optimize workforce management and budget allocation
- The goal was to uncover hidden algorithmic bias and ensure compliance with major ethical and regulatory standards.
  
**The Challenge**
- AI systems in enterprise are often "black boxes" that make critical decisions affecting employee careers, project assignments, and professional growth. Without proper oversight, these systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases, creating significant ethical, legal, and reputational risks for a company.

**My Solution: A Multi-Phase Audit**

I executed a structured, five-phase audit based on the Z-Inspection® Framework for trustworthy AI.
- Data Simulation: I created a synthetic dataset to simulate a workforce and test the platform's behavior without using real-world sensitive data.
- Bias Detection: Utilized the Aequitas bias audit toolkit to perform group disparity analysis and ran counterfactual tests to pinpoint systemic biases.
- Transparency Analysis: Examined the system's decision-making process for explainability using the SHAP (Shapley values) framework.
Regulatory Compliance: Assessed adherence to key legal frameworks, including GDPR Article 22 and the EU AI Act.

**Key Findings & Business Impact**

The audit identified several critical issues that pose significant business risk:
- Algorithmic Bias: My analysis revealed that simulated profiles for women had an 18% lower probability of being assigned to high-spending projects compared to identical male profiles.
- Regulatory Failure: The platform failed to provide a meaningful rationale for its automated decisions, directly violating GDPR Article 22.
- Lack of Explainability: The system’s cost-optimization logic was opaque and could not be clearly explained, making it impossible for users to understand or contest decisions.

**Skills Demonstrated**

- Ethical AI Auditing: Designing and executing a structured audit process.
- Algorithmic Bias Detection: Using industry-standard tools and techniques to identify and quantify unfairness in AI models.
- Regulatory Compliance: Interpreting and applying key regulations like GDPR and the EU AI Act.
- Data Analysis & Simulation: Performing quantitative analysis and creating realistic synthetic datasets.
- Technical Communication: Documenting complex findings in a clear, actionable format.
