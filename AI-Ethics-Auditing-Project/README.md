**Indiviual Project - AI Ethics Auditing Project: Enterprise Workforce Optimization Systems**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This project conducted a comprehensive ethical audit of an AI-driven platform used to optimize workforce management and budget allocation. The goal was to uncover hidden algorithmic bias and ensure compliance with major ethical and regulatory standards.
  
**The Challenge**
- AI systems in enterprise are often "black boxes" that make critical decisions affecting employee careers, project assignments, and professional growth. Without proper oversight, these systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases, creating significant ethical, legal, and reputational risks for a company.

**My Solution: A Multi-Phase Audit**

I executed a structured, five-phase audit based on the Z-Inspection® Framework for trustworthy AI.
- Data Simulation: I created a synthetic dataset to simulate a workforce and test the platform's behavior without using real-world sensitive data.
- Bias Detection: Utilized the Aequitas bias audit toolkit to perform group disparity analysis and ran counterfactual tests to pinpoint systemic biases.
- Transparency Analysis: Examined the system's decision-making process for explainability using the SHAP (Shapley values) framework.
Regulatory Compliance: Assessed adherence to key legal frameworks, including GDPR Article 22 and the EU AI Act.

**Key Findings & Business Impact**

The audit identified several critical issues that pose significant business risk:
- Algorithmic Bias: My analysis revealed that simulated profiles for women had an 18% lower probability of being assigned to high-spending projects compared to identical male profiles.
- Regulatory Failure: The platform failed to provide a meaningful rationale for its automated decisions, directly violating GDPR Article 22.
- Lack of Explainability: The system’s cost-optimization logic was opaque and could not be clearly explained, making it impossible for users to understand or contest decisions.

**Skills Demonstrated**

- Ethical AI Auditing: Designing and executing a structured audit process.
- Algorithmic Bias Detection: Using industry-standard tools and techniques to identify and quantify unfairness in AI models.
- Regulatory Compliance: Interpreting and applying key regulations like GDPR and the EU AI Act.
- Data Analysis & Simulation: Performing quantitative analysis and creating realistic synthetic datasets.
- Technical Communication: Documenting complex findings in a clear, actionable format.

** Group Presentation - AI and Fake Reviews: Amazon's Struggle Against Bots**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project analyzes the escalating "technological arms race" between AI-generated fake reviews and the detection systems on e-commerce platforms like Amazon. It presents a comprehensive overview of the problem's ethical and economic impacts and proposes a strategic, multi-layered solution.

**The Problem**

AI-generated reviews are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making them difficult for current detection systems to identify. This leads to:

- Erosion of Consumer Trust: Consumers are increasingly unable to rely on online reviews to make purchasing decisions.
- Unfair Competitive Advantage: Products with fake, AI-generated reviews gain an unfair boost, harming honest sellers and misleading consumers.
- Economic Harm: The proliferation of fake reviews leads to reduced sales for legitimate businesses and contributes to a less trustworthy online marketplace.

**Analysis of Existing Systems**

My analysis of Amazon’s current system reveals several critical limitations:
- Ineffective against AI-Generated Reviews: The system relies on traditional machine learning and behavioral signals that are easily bypassed by modern AI bots.
- No Real-time Network Graph Analysis: There is a lack of real-time analysis to identify coordinated bot networks and their relationships, allowing them to operate at scale.
- Limited Transparency: The system lacks clear explainability, making it difficult for human moderators to understand why a review was flagged, which slows down the moderation process.

**My Proposed Solution: A Multi-Layered Approach**

- I designed a robust, adaptive detection system to counter AI-generated reviews more effectively. The system is comprised of three key layers:
- Behavioral Trust Graphs: An initial layer that uses a network graph to identify coordinated bot activity in real time, stopping it before it impacts reviews.
- LLM-Adaptive Detection: A core layer that uses Large Language Models to analyze the semantic patterns of reviews, identifying subtle nuances of AI-generated content.
- Explainable AI for Moderators: A final layer that provides clear, human-readable explanations for why a review was flagged, allowing for faster and more consistent manual audits.

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Strategic Analysis: Identifying and deconstructing a complex, real-world business problem.
- Problem-Solving: Developing a multi-faceted, technical solution to address core system limitations.
- Ethical & Regulatory Insight: Analyzing the ethical implications of AI misuse and understanding relevant legal frameworks like the FTC Act and EU Digital Services Act.
- Data-Driven Research: Citing industry statistics and research to support findings and proposed solutions.
