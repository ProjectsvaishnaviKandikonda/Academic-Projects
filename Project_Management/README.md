This repository presents a collection of my academic projects, demonstrating my expertise in various facets of project management, from strategic planning and risk management to lifecycle methodologies and innovation.


**Project Management Plan: The RateMyLandlord Application**
------------------------------------------------------------------
This project showcases a comprehensive Project Management Plan (PMP) for "RateMyLandlord," a web application designed to empower tenants. This work demonstrates my ability to plan and manage a complex software project from a business and technical perspective.

**My Key Contributions:**

- Risk Management: I led the development of a detailed Risk Management Plan, identifying potential threats (e.g., legal challenges, security vulnerabilities) and outlining strategies for proactive mitigation.
- Quality Management: I was responsible for the Quality Management Plan, defining the standards, metrics, and testing strategy to ensure the application's reliability and user satisfaction.
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): I helped create the WBS, which systematically broke down the entire project into manageable tasks and deliverables, showcasing my skills in organizational planning.

**SDLC Strategy: Hospital Patient Management System (HPMS)**
------------------------------------------------------------------
This project focused on selecting the most effective Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach for a large-scale Hospital Patient Management System.

**My Strategic Proposal:**

- I proposed a hybrid Agile-RUP approach, arguing that it strikes the ideal balance between the flexibility of Agile and the structured, risk-mitigating framework of RUP.
- The approach was designed to support strict regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) through structured documentation and use-case-driven development, which is critical for healthcare systems.
- By combining these methodologies, the plan ensured frequent stakeholder collaboration and managed, phased development, reducing risk and allowing for continuous quality assurance.

**Innovative Project Planning: UCD Library Redesign**
------------------------------------------------------------------

This project utilized divergent and convergent thinking to develop a strategic proposal for redesigning the UCD Library's workspaces. This demonstrates my ability to apply creative and structured thinking to solve complex problems.

**My Approach:**

- I used the SCAMPER technique to generate a range of innovative ideas, such as replacing static computer labs with mobile tablets and merging "tech" and "talk" zones to foster a more collaborative learning environment.

- The project prioritized a user-centered design, focusing on solutions that directly addressed student needs for greater collaboration, modularity, and seamless access to technology.

- I proposed tangible, tech-enabled solutions, including modular desks with integrated projectors and charging plugs, which showcased my ability to think both creatively and practically.
