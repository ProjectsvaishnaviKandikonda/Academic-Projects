Analysis of Model Control Techniques on Text Summarization Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project involved an analysis of how model controls, specifically temperature and system prompts, affect the performance of text summarization. The study used a variety of content types, including technical documents, news articles, and social media posts, to examine how different settings influence the quality and characteristics of the generated summaries. I gained hands-on experience by conducting a series of experiments on a Hugging Face Space to systematically analyze how these controls influenced the generated output. The findings indicate that various content types demand different settings to produce effective summaries.

**Skills:**

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Focused on the fundamental NLP task of text summarization.

- Model Control & Analysis: Analyzed and documented how low and high-temperature settings and different system prompts impact the output of a language model.

- Data Analysis: Systematically recorded outcomes from experiments to draw conclusions about the relationship between model controls and content types.

- Academic Research & Writing: Wrote a detailed paper documenting the methodology, results, and discussion of the experimental findings.

- Hugging Face: Utilized a Hugging Face Space for conducting experiments and generating summaries.

Founders' Interactive Guide to Language Models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developed a web-based educational resource to bridge the knowledge gap for startup founders and entrepreneurs regarding large language models (LLMs). The guide provides a high-level understanding of how LLMs function, their limitations, and the ethical considerations involved in their use. The resource promotes active learning through simulations, interactive questions, and self-guided exploration via use cases.

**Skills:**

- Large Language Models (LLMs): Understanding of core concepts such as prompt engineering, temperature and sampling, hallucinations, and ethical considerations.

- Streamlit: Used to build the interactive, modular web application, which allowed for quick prototyping and user-friendly interaction.

- Web Development: Designed and structured a user-friendly site with logically sequenced pages.

- Project Management: Managed the project, including defining the target audience, setting learning objectives, and addressing challenges like a time-constrained audience and the risk of oversimplifying complex ideas.
