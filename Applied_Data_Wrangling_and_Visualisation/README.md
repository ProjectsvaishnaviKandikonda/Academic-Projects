**Airbnb’s role in Dublin’s tourism and housing market**

This project investigates Airbnb’s role in Dublin’s tourism and housing market, using datasets from Inside Airbnb. The analysis explores seasonal demand trends, guest satisfaction, investment opportunities, and host behaviour.

**When Does Airbnb Demand Spike in Dublin?**

This part of the project focused on analysing the patterns of Airbnb demand across different timeframes. It highlights how tourism, seasonality, and weekly activity affect short-term rental trends.

**My Role & Contributions**

I was responsible for data preparation and statistical analysis, contributing to the following tasks:

- Data Cleaning: Processed and validated Airbnb review datasets to ensure accuracy.
- Trend Analysis: Conducted statistical analysis of yearly growth, seasonal peaks, and weekly review activity.
- Visualisation: Created R-based graphs illustrating demand fluctuations across months, seasons, and neighbourhoods.
- Debugging & Accuracy: Ensured correctness of data transformations and collaborated with the team to interpret findings.

**Key Insights**

- Demand peaks during summer (June–August) and December due to tourism and holidays.
- Fridays and Saturdays show the highest activity, reflecting short-term weekend trips.
- Year-on-year review growth indicates steady expansion of Dublin’s Airbnb market.
- Neighbourhood-level patterns highlight hotspots near attractions and transport hubs.
