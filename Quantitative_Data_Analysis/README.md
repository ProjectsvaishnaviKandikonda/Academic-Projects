This repository contains two independent quantitative data analysis projects conducted in R. The first project investigates the relationship between system usability (SUS) and perceived task load (RTLX) in voice user interfaces. The second project analyzes the impact of auditory versus visual interruptions on Tetris gameplay performance.

Project 1: Usability and Workload
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Objective:** To explore the correlation between System Usability Scale (SUS) scores and Raw Task Load Index (RTLX) scores to determine if higher usability is associated with lower perceived workload.

**Hypothesis:** There is a negative correlation between usability and task load; as usability increases, perceived task load decreases.

**Methodology:**

- Data: A dataset of SUS and RTLX scores was used.
- Analysis: Descriptive statistics were calculated, and a Pearson correlation test was performed.
- Visualization: A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between the two variables.
- Key Findings: A significant negative correlation (r=âˆ’0.673, p<0.001) was found, supporting the hypothesis that higher usability is associated with lower perceived task load.

Project 2: Interruptions and Gameplay Performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Objective:** To determine whether auditory or visual interruptions have a greater impact on Tetris gameplay performance.

**Hypothesis:** Auditory interruptions will be less disruptive to gameplay than visual interruptions.

**Methodology:**

- Data: A dataset of Tetris scores categorized by interruption condition (auditory or visual) was analyzed.

- Analysis: An independent samples t-test was used to compare the mean scores between the two conditions.

- Visualization: A histogram was generated to show the distribution of scores for both conditions.

- Key Findings: Participants in the auditory interruption condition scored significantly higher (M=67.94) than those in the visual condition (M=46.63), with a significant difference (t(62)=7.46,p<.001).

Both projects demonstrate my ability to use quantitative methods and statistical software to answer research questions and draw data-driven conclusions.
