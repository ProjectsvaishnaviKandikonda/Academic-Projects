This repository showcases a selection of my projects in User-Centered Design (UXD), demonstrating my expertise in the end-to-end design process, from foundational research to critical analysis of design principles.

**Sustainify: Food Waste Management & Zero Hunger App**
------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was a collaborative effort to design a mobile application, Sustainify, aimed at combating food waste and hunger. This project demonstrates my ability to apply a user-centered design process to develop a practical, high-fidelity solution.

**My Role & Contributions**

I was a key member of the design team, contributing to the full project lifecycle:

- Requirement Gathering: I participated in user interviews and online surveys to understand user needs related to food waste and donation.

- Low-Fidelity Design: I was involved in creating the initial paper sketches and wireframes that formed the blueprint for the application's interface.

- High-Fidelity Design: I contributed to the final visual design, which included the main dashboard, food request and donation pages, and feedback screens, ensuring a clean and intuitive user experience.

**Key Features of Sustainify**

- Smart Reminders: Notifications to track food expiry dates.

- Donation Hubs: Easy-to-use features for donating surplus food to nearby charities.

- User-Centric Interface: A clean, simple interface with clear calls-to-action to facilitate daily use.

**Critique on Interface Metaphors**
------------------------------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates my ability to critically analyze foundational principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My critique focuses on the strengths and ethical considerations of using interface metaphors in design.

**Key Insights**

- Bridging Human and Machine: I explored how metaphors simplify user interaction by making digital actions familiar and intuitive.

- Ethical Considerations: The critique highlights the risks of using anthropomorphic elements that can mislead users into perceiving technology as human-like.

- Areas for Further Discussion: I proposed further research into the limitations of metaphors in representing AI-driven interfaces and the impact of cultural differences on their effectiveness.
